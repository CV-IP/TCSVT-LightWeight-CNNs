### TensorflowExamples
This contains the basic proposed modules in Tensorflow<br/>
TensorflowExamples/basicModules.py contains the proposed **LIST**, **GSAT** modules <br/>
It also contains the framework for **LIST** based up/down-sampling in a CNN  <br/>

### PytorchExamples
It contains the basic proposed modules in Pytorch <br/>

* block.py has the implementatin of **LIST** module based DnCNN denoising framework
* Denoising_demo.ipynb is a notebook to reflect our training/inference setup for DnCNN experiments
